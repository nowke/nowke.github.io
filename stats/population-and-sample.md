title: Population and Sample

Study of statistics is the study of data. The two important types of data sets (and often confused) are
**Population** and **Sample**.

* **Population Data** - Includes everything from the data set
* **Sample Data** - Well chosen sample from the Population

Throwing some more details:

### Population Data
***Examples***:
* Semester grades of **all** students in Business Analytics class at UCSD
* Height of **all** current International Baseball players
* Daily usage of smartphones by **all** kids of age 6-13 in Canada

In practical, population data can be very huge. It is challenging to collect all the members of a Population. That is where **sampling** of data helps to draw conclusions.

### Sample Data
* A subset of population
* A good sample represents the whole population 

### Differences

|                           | Population           | Sample       |
|---------------------------|----------------------|--------------|
| Measurable characteristic | Parameter            | Statistic    |
| Mean                      | μ ("mu")             | x̅ ("x-bar")  |
| Standard Deviation        | σ ("sigma")          | S            |
| Variance                  | σ² ("sigma-squared") | S²           |

### Formula Differences

Population Std. Deviation - $$\sigma = {\sqrt{\sum (X - \mu)^2 \over n}}$$

Sample Std. Deviation - $$S = {\sqrt{\sum (x - \bar{x}^2) \over n-1}}$$
