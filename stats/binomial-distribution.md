### Binomial experiment

A Binomial experiment has the following properties.

* Consists of fixed number of trials (n)
* Trials are independent of each other
* Each trial can be either success or failure
* Probability of success (P) on each trial remains the same

***Example: *** Number of heads in after flipping a coin 10 times

* The experiment is conducted for fixed number of trials - 10
* Probability of getting head in one trial does not affect the other
* Probability of getting head in any trial remains same - 0.5 (in a non-biased coin)

### Binomial variable

> A binomial variable is the number of successes (x) out of all the trials (n).

What is the probability of getting 5 heads after flipping a coin 10 times? Here $$x = 5$$ is a binomial variable.

The probability distribution of a binomial variable is called **Binomial distribution**.
