In this post, we will be creating a simple scalable dashboard that updates in real-time using [React](ll), [GraphQL Subscriptions](ll) and [Redis PubSub](ll). Real-time dashboards can be used to monitor your **infrastructure** (servers, network, services), **application traffic** (transaction volume, number of users), **alerts** (application health, critical issues, downtimes) etc. Almost always, dashboards are backed up with one or more datasources.

There are many open-source applications that can be used to create dashboards. For example, **[Kibana](ll)** can be used to visualize application logs integrated with [ELK Stack](ll). **[Grafana](ll)** can be used to create a variety of visualizations on top of time series databases such as [Prometheus](ll), [Graphite](ll) and [OpenTSDB](ll). But, as of today, they support [pull-based model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pull_technology). That is, when a user opens the browser, application makes the queries and result is rendered. It is the most widely used model as opposed to a [Push model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Push_technology). 

## When push-model can be used?

Assume you have a dashboard containing ***20 panels***, querying data from multiple datasources at the backend in real-time. User has set a refresh rate of ***5 seconds***. If, on an average ***100 users*** open the dashboard at any time - that is ***20 x 100 = 2000 requests*** every 5 seconds! This is manageable if you have good infrastructure for your underlying time-series database. Multiple Heavy queries can pile-up the memory. This problem can be solved either by introducing some intelligent caching, or a simple push-model using [WebSockets](ll). It is useful (and simple), for the situation where multiple users are querying for the same data, at same or slightly-different time. 

* Connection is established between server and client using WebSocket.
* Server sends the required data to Client at regular intervals
* If the connection breaks, client can retry indefinitely.

### What are we building?

Here's the preview of a simple real-time dashboard we will be building. It contains 4 panels - CPU Utilization, Traffic information, Data-center distribution and alerts.

## GraphQL Subscriptions

[GraphQL](ll) is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. Check out [graphql.org](https://graphql.org/) for more info if you are not familiar with GraphQL.

Along with [queries](ll) and [mutations](ll), GraphQL introduced one more specification - [Subscriptions](ll). 

>  just as the list of mutations that the server supports describes all of the actions that a client can take, the list of subscriptions that the server supports describes all of the events that it can subscribe to. Just as a client can tell the server what data to refetch after it performs a mutation with a GraphQL selection, the client can tell the server what data it wants to be pushed with the subscription with a GraphQL selection. - [GraphQL blog](https://graphql.org/blog/subscriptions-in-graphql-and-relay/)

For example, client can subscribe for CPU data using the following subscription syntax

```graphql
subscription CPU {
  cpu {
    percentage
  }
}
```

Server can publish the data at regular intervals,

```js
pubsub.publish(CPU, { cpu: { percentage: 65 } });
```

## Redis PubSub

Since version 2.0, Redis supports [Publish-Subscribe pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish/subscribe) using commands [PUBLISH](https://redis.io/commands/publish), [SUBSCRIBE](https://redis.io/commands/subscribe) and [UNSUBSCRIBE](https://redis.io/commands/unsubscribe). Read more about it from [Redis Documentation](https://redis.io/topics/pubsub).

Message can be published via **channels**. If we want to send message `"hello listeners"` via channel `myradio`, simply use the `PUBLISH` command

```bash
PUBLISH myradio "hello listeners"
```

But, a channel is useless if nobody is listening on the other side! Open another tab with `redis-cli` and subscribe to the channel `myradio`.

```bash
SUBSCRIBE myradio
```

Now, send the publish command again and watch for the same in the other terminal

### Combining GraphQL subscription & Redis PubSub

We can implement GraphQL subscription specification using [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/)'s package - [graphql-subscriptions](https://github.com/apollographql/graphql-subscriptions). 

Using Redis as mediator for publishing events from client to server enables us horizontally scale. We can plug in [graphql-redis-subscriptions](https://github.com/davidyaha/graphql-redis-subscriptions) as PubSubEngine interface to `graphql-subscriptions`.

## Sample Implementation

For full implementation - see [github.com/nowke/realtime-dashboard-demo/](https://github.com/nowke/realtime-dashboard-demo/). We will look at the important parts here.

We're going to build 3 components

* Server
* Client - user's browser, connects to server
* Worker - mocks real events by publishing events to server

### Server

Install the required pacakges

```
yarn add graphql apollo-server graphql-redis-subscriptions graphql-subscriptions ioredis moment
```

If you have `redis-server` running in local at `PORT 6379`, setup the PubSub using `graphql-redis-subscriptions`. We will use it to publish messages

**[`server/pubsub.js`](https://github.com/nowke/realtime-dashboard-demo/blob/master/server/pubsub.js)**
```js
const { RedisPubSub } = require("graphql-redis-subscriptions");

const pubsub = new RedisPubSub();
module.exports = pubsub;
```

Define the GraphQL schema. We use,

* **Query** - for getting initial result from Redis
* **Mutation** - to publish new messages
* **Subscription** - websocket connection between client and server for real-time updating the graphs

```graphql
const { gql } = require("apollo-server");

const schema = gql`
  type Dps {
    timestamp: Int!
    value: Float!
  }

  type Traffic {
    total: Int!
    dps: [Dps]
  }

  type CPU {
    percentage: Float!
  }

  type Distribution {
    region: String!
    percentage: Float!
  }

  type Message {
    title: String!
    description: String!
    color: String!
  }

  type Query {
    cpu: CPU
    traffic: Traffic
    distribution: [Distribution]
    messages: [Message]
  }

  type Mutation {
    cpu: CPU
    traffic: Traffic
    distribution: [Distribution]
    messages: [Message]
  }

  type Subscription {
    cpu: CPU
    traffic: Traffic
    distribution: [Distribution]
    messages: [Message]
  }
`;

module.exports = schema;
```

I have provided helper functions to generate dummy data for each 4 panels. Refer [`server/utils/generator.js`](https://github.com/nowke/realtime-dashboard-demo/blob/master/server/utils/generator.js). Using these functions, let's write a function `publishRandomData`.

```js
const pubsub = require("./pubsub");
const { set } = require("./utils/redis");

const COMPONENTS = {
  CPU: "cpu",
  TRAFFIC: "traffic",
  DISTRIBUTION: "distribution",
  MESSAGES: "messages"
};

const publishRandomData = async (generator, component) => {
  const data = generator();
  pubsub.publish(component, { [component]: data });
  await set(component, data);
  return data;
};
```

We can call this function for CPU usage as below

```js
const getCPU = () => 50;
await publishRandomData(getCPU, "CPU")
```

Define the resolver functions for the schema we wrote earlier (sample for CPU)

**[`server/resolvers.js`](https://github.com/nowke/realtime-dashboard-demo/blob/master/server/resolvers.js)**
```js
const { get } = require("./utils/redis");

module.exports = {
  Query: {
    cpu: () => get(COMPONENTS.CPU)
  },
  Mutation: {
    cpu: () => publishRandomData(cpuData, COMPONENTS.CPU),
  },
  Subscription: {
    cpu: {
      subscribe: () => pubsub.asyncIterator(COMPONENTS.CPU)
    },
  }
}
```

Start the server

**[`server/index.js`](https://github.com/nowke/realtime-dashboard-demo/blob/master/server/index.js)**
```js
const { ApolloServer } = require("apollo-server");

const typeDefs = require("./schema");
const resolvers = require("./resolvers");

// Server
const server = new ApolloServer({ typeDefs, resolvers });

server.listen().then(({ url }) => {
  console.log(`ðŸš€  Server ready at ${url}`);
});
```

```
$ yarn start
yarn run v1.13.0
$ nodemon index.js
...
ðŸš€  Server ready at http://localhost:4000/
```

Open [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000/) to open GraphQL playground.

Subscribe to CPU percentage in **Tab 1** and hit the play button

```graphql
subscription {
  cpu {
    percentage
  }
}
```

Run the mutation for CPU in **Tab 2**, to publish random percentage value. You should receive the value as an event in **Tab 1**. Try the mutation multiple times to receive different values.

```graphql
mutation {
  cpu {
    percentage
  }
}
```

Run the query for CPU in **Tab 3**. You should see the last published value - this is because we have cached the recent value in Redis

```graphql
query {
  cpu {
    percentage
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "data": {
    "cpu": {
      "percentage": 25
    }
  }
}
```
