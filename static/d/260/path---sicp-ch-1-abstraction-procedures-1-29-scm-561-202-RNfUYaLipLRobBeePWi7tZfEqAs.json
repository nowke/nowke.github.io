{"data":{"github":{"repository":{"object":{"__typename":"GitHub_Blob","text":"; Simpson’s Rule is a more accurate method of numerical \n; integration than the method illustrated above. Using \n; Simpson’s Rule, the integral of a function f between a \n; and b is approximated as\n; (h/3)*(y0 +4y1 +2y2 +4y3 +2y4 +···+2yn−2 +4yn−1 +yn)\n; where h = (b − a)/n, for some even integer n, and \n; yk = f (a + kh). (Increasing n increases the accuracy \n; of the approximation.) Define a procedure that takes \n; as arguments f, a, b, and n and returns the value of \n; the integral, computed using Simpson’s Rule. Use your \n; procedure to integrate cube between 0 and 1 \n; (with n = 100 and n = 1000), and compare the results \n; to those of the integral procedure shown above.\n\n(define (integral f a b n)\n    (define (coefficient k)\n        (cond ((or (= k 0) (= k n)) 1)\n              ((even? k) 2)\n              (else 4)))\n    (define h (/ (- b a) n))\n    (define (y-of-k k) (f (+ a (* k h))))\n\n    (define (iter k sum)\n        (cond ((= k -1) sum)\n              (else (iter (- k 1)\n                          (+ sum\n                             (* (coefficient k)\n                                (y-of-k k)))))\n        )\n    )\n    (* (/ h 3) (iter n 0))\n)\n\n(define (cube x) (* x x x))\n(integral cube 0 1 100)  ;Value: .24999999999999992\n(integral cube 0 1 1000) ;Value: .2500000000000003"}}}},"pageContext":{"name":"1.29.scm","expr":"master:sicp/ch1-abstraction-procedures/1.29.scm"}}
