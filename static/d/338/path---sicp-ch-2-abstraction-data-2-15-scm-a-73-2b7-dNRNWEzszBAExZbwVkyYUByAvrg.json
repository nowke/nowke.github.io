{"data":{"github":{"repository":{"object":{"__typename":"GitHub_Blob","text":"; Eva Lu Ator, another user, has also noticed the different \n; intervals computed by different but algebraically equivalent \n; expressions. She says that a formula to compute with intervals \n; using Alyssa’s system will produce tighter error bounds if it \n; can be written in such a form that no variable that represents \n; an uncertain number is repeated. Thus, she says, par2 is a \n; “better” program for parallel resistances than par1. Is she right? \n; Why?\n\n; Eva's hypothesis seems to be correct. From our previous exercise,\n; we found that A/A is not exactly \"1\", hence the more we avoid \n; repitition, more accurate our operations can be.
