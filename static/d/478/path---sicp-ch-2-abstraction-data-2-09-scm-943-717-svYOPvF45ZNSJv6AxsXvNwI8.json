{"data":{"github":{"repository":{"object":{"__typename":"GitHub_Blob","text":"; The width of an interval is half of the difference between its \n; upper and lower bounds. The width is a measure of the uncertainty \n; of the number specified by the interval. For some arithmetic \n; operations the width of the result of combining two intervals is \n; a function only of the widths of the argument intervals, whereas \n; for others the width of the combination is not a function of the \n; widths of the argument intervals. Show that the width of the sum \n; (or difference) of two intervals is a function only of the widths \n; of the intervals being added (or subtracted). Give examples to \n; show that this is not true for multiplication or division.\n\n(define (make-interval a b) (cons a b))\n(define (lower-bound z) (car z))\n(define (upper-bound z) (cdr z))\n(define (add-interval x y)\n    (make-interval (+ (lower-bound x) (lower-bound y))\n                   (+ (upper-bound x) (upper-bound y))))\n(define (mul-interval x y)\n    (let ((p1 (* (lower-bound x) (lower-bound y)))\n          (p2 (* (lower-bound x) (upper-bound y)))\n          (p3 (* (upper-bound x) (lower-bound y)))\n          (p4 (* (upper-bound x) (upper-bound y))))\n      (make-interval (min p1 p2 p3 p4)\n                     (max p1 p2 p3 p4))))\n\n; Define `width`\n(define (width-interval z)\n    (/ (- (upper-bound z) (lower-bound z)) 2))\n\n; (i) Testing with addition\n;   width1 = (1.8-1.5)/2 = 0.15\n;   width2 = (5.75-5.6)/2 = 0.075\n;   width1 + width2 = 0.225\n;   also, width-add = (7.55 - 7.1)/2 = 0.225\n(define interval1 (add-interval\n                    (make-interval 1.5 1.8)\n                    (make-interval 5.6 5.75)))\n(width-interval interval1) ;Value: .2250000000000001\n; => width of the sum (or difference) of two intervals is a \n;    function only of the widths of the intervals being added \n;    (or subtracted)\n\n; (ii) Testing with multiplication\n;    width1 = 0.15, width2 = 0.075 => width1 * width2 = 0.01125\n;   also, width-mul = (10.35 - 8.4)/2 = 0.975\n(define interval2 (mul-interval\n                    (make-interval 1.5 1.8)\n                    (make-interval 5.6 5.75)))\n(width-interval interval2) ;Value: .9750000000000005\n; => width of the multiplication (or division) of two intervals is\n;    \"not\" a function of widths of intervals being multiplied\n;    (or divided)"}}}},"pageContext":{"name":"2.09.scm","expr":"master:sicp/ch2-abstraction-data/2.09.scm"}}
