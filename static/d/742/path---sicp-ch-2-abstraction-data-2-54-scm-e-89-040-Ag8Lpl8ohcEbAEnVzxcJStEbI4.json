{"data":{"github":{"repository":{"object":{"__typename":"GitHub_Blob","text":"; Two lists are said to be equal? if they contain equal elements arranged in the \n; same order. For example,\n; (equal? '(this is a list) '(this is a list)) \n; is true, but\n; (equal? '(this is a list) '(this (is a) list))\n; is false. To be more precise, we can define `equal?` recursively in terms of the \n; basic eq? equality of symbols by saying that a and b are `equal?` if they are \n; both symbols and the symbols are eq?, or if they are both lists such that (car a) \n; is equal? to (car b) and (cdr a) is equal? to (cdr b). Using this idea, \n; implement equal? as a procedure.\n\n(define (equal? list1 list2)\n    (cond ((not (or (pair? list1) (pair? list2)))\n           (eq? list1 list2))\n          ((and (pair? list1) (pair? list2))\n           (and (equal?
