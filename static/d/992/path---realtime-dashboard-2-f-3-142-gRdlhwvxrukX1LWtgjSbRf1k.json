{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>In this post, we will be creating a simple scalable dashboard that updates in real-time using <a href=\"ll\">React</a>, <a href=\"ll\">GraphQL Subscriptions</a> and <a href=\"ll\">Redis PubSub</a>. Real-time dashboards can be used to monitor your <strong>infrastructure</strong> (servers, network, services), <strong>application traffic</strong> (transaction volume, number of users), <strong>alerts</strong> (application health, critical issues, downtimes) etc. Almost always, dashboards are backed up with one or more datasources.</p>\n<p>There are many open-source applications that can be used to create dashboards. For example, <strong><a href=\"ll\">Kibana</a></strong> can be used to visualize application logs integrated with <a href=\"ll\">ELK Stack</a>. <strong><a href=\"ll\">Grafana</a></strong> can be used to create a variety of visualizations on top of time series databases such as <a href=\"ll\">Prometheus</a>, <a href=\"ll\">Graphite</a> and <a href=\"ll\">OpenTSDB</a>.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Real-time Dashboard"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/realtime-dashboard/"}}
